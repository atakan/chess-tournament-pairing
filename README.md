# chess-tournament-pairing
This will hopefully turn into a repository of programs related to pairing and simulation for chess tournaments. It will mostly be Swiss pairing and in particular the Dutch system as used by FIDE. However, I may add other systems as well, especially if I move towards simulation.

At least some of the programs use wrappers around JaVaFo, by ... I do not distribute this program. You need to download it from here, extract the jave archive and put "main.jar" in some place accesible to the programs. This program implements Swiss pairing (Dutch system) as described by the FIDE handbook.

You will also need to install Java (JDK) and a number of Python libraries. I install the latter via pip and I recommend this method, rather than installing from scratch or installing system wide libraries. My platform is Debian GNU/Linux. If you use a different platform and needed to tweak things, I would be happy to share your instructions.
